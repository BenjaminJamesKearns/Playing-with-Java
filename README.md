# Playing-with-Java

This is a project I used to gain experience in Java.

The program is based in command line, it allows the user to use a menu to navigate through 4 different programs, hello world, fizzbuzz, notes and bank account.

## Hello world

The hello world program can print "hello world", or print "hello" + a name given by the user.

## Fizzbuzz

The user can enter a number, if it is a multiple of 3 the program writes "Fizz", if it is a multiple of 5 it writes "Buzz" and if it is a multiple of 3 and 5 it writes "Fizzbuzz".

## Notes

The user can create notes, with a title and a body, and view any of these notes.

## Bank account

The user can view their balance, deposit and withdraw from their account.
